### Intro to Blockchain
- What is a transaction?

A transaction is set of instructions that alters the ledger.

- What is the approximate time of every Ethereum transaction?

It dependes on how fast a block of transaction is produced, what is the congestion of the network and how much gas the sender of the transaction is willing to pay.
Approximately a block is produced every 13 seconds.

- What is a node?

A node is a computer that processes transactions, relays the received transactions to the rest of the nodes ("gossiping"), maintains a local state of the general ledger and work to reach a consensus with the rest of the network, over the current state of the ledger, through consesus algorithms.
